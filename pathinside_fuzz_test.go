// FuzzInsideMatchesRelOracle drives Root.Contains with arbitrary path pairs and

// is not "..". The oracle splits the relative path into segments rather than
// testing a string prefix, so it is not a restatement of the implementation — a
// regression to the naive strings.HasPrefix(rel, "..") form disagrees with it on
// every name that merely begins with two dots ("..extras"), and a regression to
// a strings.HasPrefix(target, root) containment test disagrees on every
// prefix sibling ("/a/b-evil" under "/a/b").
//
// Every path reported inside additionally has to survive reconstruction: its
// relative form must be non-escaping, must not be absolute, and joining it back
// onto the root must reproduce the cleaned target. That is the property callers
// actually rely on — a path reported inside can be re-derived as root plus a
// downward path, so it cannot reach outside when it is joined.

// a real path out of fuzz input.
